Portfolio Website


Design Choices

    -The design of this portfolio was centered around a clean and professional aesthetic, with a personal touch. I opted for a light pink and pink color scheme, which reflects a soft, inviting tone while maintaining a modern and organized layout. These color choices are intended to evoke a sense of creativity and individuality, which aligns with my personal style.

    -The layout is simple and navigable, ensuring that users can easily browse through sections like "Projects," "Skills," and "Education" without being overwhelmed. The project showcases, such as "The RGO Project Management System" and "Survey Form," are presented clearly, with attention to accessibility and responsiveness across different devices.



Challenges Faced and How They Resolved


1. Responsiveness

    -Initially, designing a fully responsive layout for different screen sizes was a challenge. The site looked great on desktops but appeared cluttered on smaller screens. To resolve this, I utilized media queries in CSS, which allowed for better control over elements based on screen size. Flexbox and grid layouts were instrumental in adjusting the design fluidly.

2. CSS Styling Consistency

    -Ensuring that the design remained consistent across different browsers was another issue. Some elements rendered differently in various browsers. After testing across platforms, I used browser-specific fixes and CSS resets to normalize the styles across all browsers.

3. Content Organization

    -It was important to strike a balance between showcasing my work and keeping the portfolio concise. To address this, I segmented content into well-defined sections with appropriate headings and used minimal text, letting the visuals and project descriptions speak for themselves. Organizing my education, skills, and projects in this manner made navigation smoother and more intuitive.

4. Version Control

    -Managing multiple iterations of the project without losing track of changes was also challenging. Using Git version control allowed me to keep track of modifications, revert changes when needed, and collaborate efficiently with any future contributors.
